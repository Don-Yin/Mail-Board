# note for user
> this requires the outlook to be legacy

# what is this
> it has a main navigation page
> a email analytics page which helps to process individual emails
> a stats page which shows the all the email activities in the past week / month / year (adjustable length)

# what needs to be done next (currently unachieved)
> don't change anything else, don't make redundant changes
> make a the navigation page and make it named so, using the default url for this page as for landing
> in this page, make two possible options, which are entering the stats page or the email analysis page (which exists already)
> build a placeholder for the stats page
